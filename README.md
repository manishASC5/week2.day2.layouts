# week2.day2.layouts

I changed something!

## Instructions
1. There are a number of common layouts that make for a great user experience. This project will focus on creating some of these layouts. Youâ€™ll find using the flexbox model vastly simplifies displaying elements in an visually appealing way for the user.
2. Fork and clone this repo: [week2.day2.layouts](https://github.com/AllStarCodeOrg/week2.day2.layouts)
3. Follow the instructions found within each folder to recreate the first three common layouts
   - Total Center
   - Sidebar
   - Holy Grail
4. If you have time, feel free to try the optional layouts, too!
   - Equal Height Elements
   - Feature Lists
   - Collection Grid w/Feature
